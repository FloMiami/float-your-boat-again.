You got it! If you prefer to keep home.html as your main page instead of index.html, GitHub Pages can be configured to use it.

Here's how to tell GitHub Pages to serve home.html as your default page:

Ensure home.html is in the root of your repository:

Before you do anything else, make sure your home.html file (along with all other HTML, CSS, and image files) is directly in the top-level directory of your GitHub repository. It shouldn't be in a subfolder.
Go to your GitHub repository:

Open your web browser and navigate to your repository on GitHub (github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name).
Click on "Settings":

This tab is usually near the top right of your repository's page.
Click on "Pages" in the left sidebar:

It's under the "Code and automation" section.
Configure the Build and Deployment Source:

Under the "Build and deployment" section:
For "Source", ensure Deploy from a branch is selected.
For "Branch", select main (or master, depending on your repository's default branch name) from the dropdown.
For "Folder", ensure it's set to / (root).
Crucial Step: Create a redirect (or direct link):
Since GitHub Pages defaults to index.html, if it doesn't find it, it might show a 404. There are two primary ways to handle this when keeping home.html:

Option A: Direct Link (Simplest, but requires users to type home.html)
Your website will be live at https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/home.html.
This means anyone visiting https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/ will likely get a 404, unless they specifically add /home.html to the URL.
This isn't ideal for user experience.

Option B: Create an index.html file that redirects to home.html (Recommended)
This is the most common and user-friendly approach. You create a tiny index.html file whose only purpose is to immediately redirect the user to home.html.

To do this (Recommended):
a.  In the same folder as your home.html and other files, create a new file named index.html.
b.  Open index.html with a text editor and paste the following code:

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
      <title>Redirecting...</title>
      <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=home.html">
      <link rel="canonical" href="home.html" />
  </head>
  <body>
      <p>If you are not redirected automatically, follow this <a href="home.html">link to our homepage</a>.</p>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```
  * `meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=home.html"`: This tells the browser to redirect to `home.html` after 0 seconds.
  * `<link rel="canonical" href="home.html" />`: This helps search engines understand that `home.html` is the primary version of this page, preventing duplicate content issues.
